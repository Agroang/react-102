// React Components ------------------------------------------------------------

// Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

// React Components:

// Components are independent and reusable bits of code.They serve the same
// purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

// Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

// In older React code bases, you may find Class components primarily used. It
// is now suggested to use Function components along with Hooks, which were
// added in React 16.8.There is an optional section on Class components for your
// reference.
