    review: "Less savory compared to Sukiya. Very clean for a chain store and fast, expected from this type of venue. No big differences with Sukiya but personally I feel that the Gyudon from Sukiya taste better.",

    review: "Less complexity more volume. It doesn't feel as 'dark' as some other chains. The food tastes just good enough, nothing too fancy. Fast as expected.",
